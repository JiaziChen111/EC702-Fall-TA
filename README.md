# EC702-Fall-TA

Discussion 1: Basic theory of differential and difference equations.

Discussion 2: Simplest analytical examples of the Solow growth model in both continuous and discrete time.

Discussion 3: Matlab codes to solve the Solow growth model in both continous and discrete time.

Discussion 4: Matlab codes to solve the reaching the center problem. The problem is written using value functions, and then the solution is implemented through value function iteration.
