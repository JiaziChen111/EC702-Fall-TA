# EC702-Fall-TA

Discussion 1: Basic theory of differential and difference equations.

Discussion 2: Simplest analytical examples of the Solow growth model in both continuous and discrete time.

Discussion 3: Matlab codes to solve the deterministic Solow growth model in both continous and discrete time.

Discussion 4: Matlab codes to solve the deterministic "reaching the center" problem. The problem is written using value functions, and then the solution is implemented through value function iteration.

Discussion 5: Matlab codes to solve the deterministic Ramsey growth model and the "cake eating" problem (which is a specific case of the Ramsey model). Both problems are solved using value function iteration.

Discussion 6: Matlab codes to solve the deterministic Ramsey growth model with endogenous labor. This is done using VFI and two alternative methods are presented to solve the model. Two more codes solve for the transition from a steady-state to a new one after a change in the parameters, in particular labor share and TFP.

Discussion 7: Matlab codes to solve the continuous time deterministic Neoclassical growth model with and without endogenous labor. We use a procedure called "Relaxation method", following Trimborn, Koch and Steger (2008).




Note: All the codes in the computational classes are written in Matlab. The credits for the codes go mostly to Pascual Restrepo and Stephen Terry.
